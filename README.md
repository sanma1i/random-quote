# random quote
This project is about building a collection of quotations- these are the quotes, author and other information that gets printed to the screen. It is done by creating a JavaScript array containing JavaScript objects- one object for each quotation. We will create a function that pulls one of those quotes at random and a function that prints that quote to the screen. Each quote object inthe quotes array should ave the following properties: quote,source,citation and year.
